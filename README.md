# Simpla Elements Catalogue
[![Published][webcomponents-badge]][webcomponents-collection]

This is an open catalogue of elements built on the [Simpla](https://www.simpla.io) content system. It's hosted on webcomponents.org][webcomponents-collection].

## Publishing your element

To publish your element to the Simpla catalogue:

1. Ensure your element has a README and follows the `simpla-` naming convention

2. Fork this repository

2. Add your element as a dependency to `bower.json`, pointing to its GitHub repository. Eg: `"element": "user/element"`

3. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/simplaio/simpla-elements/compare) against this repository

4. [Publish](https://www.webcomponents.org/publish) your element to webcomponents.org, which simpla.io will link to automatically

Once the PR is merged your element will be available in the catalogues on both [simpla.io/elements][elements-catalogue] and [webcomponents.org][webcomponents-collection].
